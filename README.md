  <h2>🎄 Advent of Code</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Advent of Code</strong> is an annual programming challenge that takes
    place every December. Each day from December 1st to 25th, a new puzzle is
    released that focuses on problem-solving, algorithms, and data structures.
  </p>

  <p>
    The puzzles start simple and gradually increase in complexity, often
    requiring careful reasoning, optimization, and clean code design. Solutions
    can be written in <em>any programming language</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This repository contains my personal solutions, notes, and experiments while
    working through the challenges.
